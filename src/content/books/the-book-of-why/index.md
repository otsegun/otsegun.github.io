## Currently Reading

I am currently working through Judea Pearl's masterpiece on causal inference. As a statistician, this is fundamental reading that challenges many of the traditional "correlation is not causation" dogmas we were taught.

## Initial Thoughts

### The Ladder of Causation
Pearl introduces three levels of cognitive capability regarding cause and effect:
1. **Association** (Seeing): What if I see X?
2. **Intervention** (Doing): What if I do X?
3. **Counterfactuals** (Imagining): What if I had done X?

It's fascinating to see how most modern AI is still stuck on the first rung, while humans navigate the third rung naturally.

### The Role of Models
The book argues that data alone is never enough for causal inference; we need a mental or mathematical model of the process that generated the data.

## Why I'm Reading This
I want to bridge the gap between predictive ML models and causal understanding, especially for decision-making systems.

*More comprehensive notes will be added once I finish the book!*
