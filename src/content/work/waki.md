Waki Community Exchange LLC is the developer of Waki, a cross-platform mobile application designed to facilitate the donation, upcycling, and swapping of physical objects. The aim is to focus on supporting communities and enhancing environmental awareness, while offering an exceptional user experience.

I supported my friend in founding the company and building the app, contributing to the development of the app's backend and frontend using Dart, Flutter, and Firebase. 

Waki app is currently published on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.wakiapp.waki&hl=es&pli=1">Google Play Store</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/es/app/waki-segunda-mano-circular/id6739874505">Apple App Store</a>. Do check it out to support our work!
