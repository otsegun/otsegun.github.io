- Developed three novel anomaly detection algorithms for big data analysis, published in *Advances in Data Analysis and Classification* and *Stat* journals. Check my [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CtT5unQAAAAJ) for more details. 

- Translated research into production‑grade open‑source software (*fdaoutlier* R package, published on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fdaoutlier/index.html">CRAN</a>) implementing algorithms in R and C++ with 86% test coverage. 

- Co‑authored comprehensive review on AI/ML models for solar irradiance prediction published in Scientific Reports (2022), evaluating deep learning architectures (LSTM, CNN) and traditional ML approaches across different temporal scales.

- Contributed to developing data processing pipeline in R and Python for COVID‑19 prevalence estimation project (<a href="https://coronasurveys.org/">CoronaSurveys</a>) using machine learning and network scale‑up methodology. Project gained international media coverage (50+ outlets across Spain, Portugal, Germany, US) and secured €300K funding from Spanish Ministry of Sciences and Innovation (<a href="https://www.aei.gob.es/ayudas-concedidas/buscador-ayudas-concedidas?code=TED2021-131264B-I00">TED2021‑131264B‑I00</a>).

- Conducted large‑scale blockchain network analysis processing 30GB+ Ethereum transaction data (millions of transactions) using network science and graph analytics. Revealed centralization patterns in mining ecosystems, identifying dominant pools and preferential attachment behaviors in distributed systems through end‑to‑end graph analytics quantifying node connectivity and edge strength distributions.
