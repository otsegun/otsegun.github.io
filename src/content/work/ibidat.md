IBIDAT is a research institute of UC3M. It was originally founded as a colaboration between UC3M and Santander Bank. It is now an independent research institute of UC3M. The research institute takes on research and industry projects in the field of data science and machine learning. I spent 2 years there as a postdoctoral fellow working on a variety of data science and machine learning projects.

- Developed and deployed large‑scale LLM‑based content classification system processing 25,000+ documents (35GB data) for a Spanish market intelligence firm. 

- Led end‑to‑end data science pipeline for a major Spanish retail group’s seasonal promotion analysis project, processing multi‑year sales data to optimize promotional ROI (€100M+ annual promotional spending). 

- Researched and developed fair machine learning model prototypes for a major Spanish bank’s credit decision systems to ensure equitable outcomes across customer applications. 

- Contributed to interpretable machine learning initiatives at a major Spanish bank.
